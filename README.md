# Praise-Unto-XHUL
A well terribly writen esolang which function names are random


This language was made for an EsoJam with the theme of "Randomness" and I decided to make it hell to program, if you want.
Everything was programmed with pure C by a mechanical engineering student who took an introduction to programming class and had fun.
There is a way to have a consistent set of instructions, in "Random.h" set the global variable at line 13 to true.
Some features may not work properly currently: Loops, If statements

Esolang wiki: (To be created when I have time)

Have fun Embrace the chaos, even if XHUL decided not to run your program


NOTE: Most recent changes(changes to Random.h and startup.h) were done to disable the developer "tools." I removed the comment from prun() in startup() and set 
constantseed in Random.h to false.
